				<h1>Spring 2020 Online Assignments</h1>
                <hr />
                <p>This page is for students who have been unable to return to Taiwan and who haven't yet handed in the assignments for PEU (Freshman). Although the deadline has passed for most of these assignments, I will accept late hand-ins, however I will subtract a few points. </p>
                <p>Email me your assingments, being sure to give me your name, student number, and original class time.</p>
                <p>Please hand in all the assignments, as not doing so will make it hard for you to pass the class.</p>

                <h2>Audio 2: Innovation</h2>

                <p>Please look over the powerpoint about little known innovators. These people all helped to contribute to the development of smartphones, computers and creating the online community that we have today, albeit indirectly. What do you think was the most important innovation in the 20th or 21st century? Please make a 1 minute audio recording about what you think, making sure to tell me what it is, and why you think it is important. This assignment is due in 1 week, on May 27th. </p>
