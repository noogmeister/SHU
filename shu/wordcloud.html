				<h1>Spring 2019 Word Cloud Project</h1>
				<hr />
				
				<h2>General Instructions</h2>
				
				<ol class="outerlist">
				

					<li>Make a group of 3 or 4 people. Choose one person to be the group leader. </li>
					<li>As a group you will write a collaborative story.</li>
					<li>After you have finished the story, each person in the group will make a different unique word cloud using the entire text from the writing.</li>
					<li>Each individual person needs to upload their word cloud. The group leader will also upload the writing file (.doc)</li>
					<li>I will grade you on the writing (as a group), and your word clouds (on an individual bases).</li>
					<li>Finally, I will choose the best 5 word clouds, and, if you are chosen, I will ask you to print a color copy of your word cloud and hand it in.</li>
					
				</ol>
					
				<h2>Step 1: Writing</h2>
				
					<p> You should divide up the writing amongst the members of your group. One person will write the beginning of the story introducing the story's characters and the background of the story. The next person (or persons) will write the middle of the story, continuing where the first person left off. If there are 4 people in your group, then the next person will do this as well. The last person will finish the story any way they feel they should. Each person must write at least 250 words. So the final story will be around 750-1000 words long. </p>
					
					<p>Feel free to be creative in your story telling. Each person can write anything they want, as long as the next person can continue with the story (so, for example,  you probably shouldn't kill off the characters unless you are the last person). </p>
					
					
				<h2>Step 2: Creating the Word Cloud</h2>
				
				<ol class="outerlist">
					
					
					<li>Go to the website <a href="https://www.wordclouds.com"> wordclouds</a>.</li>
						<ol class="innerlist1">
							<li>Size: choose 3000x2000(3:2)HD</li>
							<li><font color="red">Note:</font> It is very important that you <font color="red">do not include any personal information</font> in your word cloud. So be careful of this when you copy text into the word list.</li>
							<li>Word List: at the top click 'Paste/Type text' (you can find this under File as well) and copy and paste the text from your story and click 'Apply.'</li>
								<ol class="innerlist2">
									<li>Some of the most common words may not show in your word cloud, so you can lower the number in the word list if you need to.</li>
								</ol>
							<li>Gap Size: choose 4 to 6 or whatever you think looks best.</li>
							<li>Direction of words: choose whatever you want.</li>
							<li>Invert: use this if you want. </li>
							<li>Shape: this is very important. Choose one of the shapes they have, or add your own using 'upload.'</li>
							<li>Colors / Theme : choose the background and cloud colors you want. Or go with a theme. </li>
							<li>File: when you are finished, save your word cloud as a PNG file. The filename should be your *student number* and *English name* written together. Example: a106999123mark.png</li>
						</ol>

				</ol>
				
				<hr />
				
				
				<hr />
				<h2>Step 3: Uploading the PNG Image and Writing Files</h2>
 
				<ol class="outerlist">
					<li>Go to <a href="classtimes.html">classes</a> and click on the link under your class time. It is important that you choose the correct class time, so please don't click on the wrong class!</li>
						<ol class="innerlist1">
							<li>Follow the instructions to upload your word cloud file using the correct google form link.</li>
						</ol>
				
				</ol>
