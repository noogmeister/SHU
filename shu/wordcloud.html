				<h1>Spring 2021 Writing Project</h1>
				<hr />
				
				<h2>Step 1: General Instructions</h2>

				

				<h3><a name="part1">Part 1 The Video:</a></h3>

				<ol>
					<li>First watch the video on <i>success</i> (at the bottom of the page). Watch it once without subtitles (or with English subtitles if you want), then go to settings and turn on the Chinese subtitles and watch it again.</li>
					<li>Next go to the school's e-lean site and do this week's <i>Success</i> Assignment. Do this before you continue with the project. Give yourself some time to think about the ideas in the video.</li>
					</ol>
				<h3>Part 2 Brainstorming:</h3>
					<ol>
					<li>After you have watched the video and completed the assignment above, I want you to think about someone who has inspired you in life. This person CAN NOT be a family member.</li>
					<li>Brainstorm some ideas about this person. Just make a list at this stage.  Who is he or she? How have they become successful? (use ideas from the video). How did they affect your life? Are they really successful, or just rich? I suggest you spend one day just doing this.</li>
					</ol>
				<h3>Part 3 The Writing:</h3>
					<ol>
					<li>Now the hard part. Write a 300 to 500 word essay about this person who has inpired you. Be sure to tell me why they have inpired you, and who this person is.</li>
					<li>Make sure to use the ideas from the video, that you listed in part 2. Incorperate these ideas in your writing.</li>
					</ol>
					<!--
				<h3>Part 4 The Word Cloud:</h3>
					<ol>
					<li>When you make your word cloud add the text from Wikipedia to your own text so they will be mixed together in your word cloud.</li>
					<li>For example, if your English teacher at SHU has inspired you, you will use the words from your paper, and the words from wikipedia concerning English Teaching.</li>
					<li>Another example would be, let's say, someone famous like Lady Gaga has inspired you. Then you would use the words from your paper and the wikipedia article about Lady Gaga to make the word cloud.</li>
					<li>When you upload  your assigment I only want your original writing, and your word cloud. I do not want the text you took from Wikipedia.</li>
					</ol>
					-->
				</ol>
					
				<!--
				<h2>Step 2: Creating the Word Cloud</h2>
				
				
					
					
					<h3>Go to the website <a href="https://www.wordclouds.com"> wordclouds</a>.</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Size: choose (4:3)HD which is the default.</li>
							<li><font color="red">Note:</font> It is very important that you <font color="red">do not include any personal information</font> in your word cloud. So be careful of this when you copy text into the word list.</li>
							<li>Word List: at the top click 'Paste/Type text' (you can find this under File as well) and copy and paste the text from your story and click 'Apply.'
								<ol  class="b">
									<li>Some of the most common words may not show in your word cloud, so you can lower the number in the word list if you need them to show.</li>
									<li>You can also increase the number to make words larger, or decrease the number if you want the words to look smaller.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Gap Size: choose 4 to 6 or whatever you think looks best.</li>
							<li>Direction of words: choose whatever you want.</li>
							<li>Invert: use this if you want. </li>
							<li>Colors / Theme : choose the background and cloud colors you want. Or go with a theme. </li>
							<li>File: when you are finished, save your word cloud as a PNG file. The filename should be your *student number* and *English name* written together. Example: a106999123mark.png</li>
							<li>Finally, you will upload both your word cloud and your writing using the Google Forms links below.</li>
						</ol>

				<h2>Step 2: Uploading Writing Files</h2>
				<h3>Due Date: after it is assigned (not including spring break)</h3>
				<p>Check the e-learn system on the date the writing was assigned. There should be a google forms link there. Upload your writing there.</p>
