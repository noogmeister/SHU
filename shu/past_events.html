				<h1>Past Events </h1>
				<hr />
				<p>Choose a significant event that has happened in the last 100 years. </p>
				<p>The event could be something man made, such as:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>An invention like the internet.</li>
					<li>A discovery such as penicillin.</li>
					<li>The death of an important figure such as JFK's assassination.</li>
					<li>A war or attack such as the West's war on terrorism, or World War 2.</li>
					<li>The event could be local as well, such as Taiwan's 228 incident.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Or a natural disaster such as: </p>
				
				<ol>
				
					<li>The Indonesian or Japanese  earthquakes (and subsequent tsunamis).</li>
					<li>The Great Fog of London (1952, actually this is both natural and man made).</li>
					<li>Hurricane Katrina, or Harvey, or one of Taiwan's many Typhoons or earthquakes.</li>
								
				</ol>
				<p>Form a group of 3-4 people (2 with permission) and as a group prepare a powerpoint presentation about your event. Tell the class the following:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>What is the event?</li>
					<li>When did the event take place?</li>
					<li>Who are the players involved in the event, if any?</li>
					<li>How has this event changed the way we live our lives today? What impact has it had?</li>
					<li>How would our lives be different if this event never happened?</li>
					<li>Your own personal reaction or feelings concerning this event. </li>
									
				</ol>
				<p>The presentation should be between 3 and 5 minutes in length. Everyone should talk for at least one minute. It is important that you cite sources used, and try to use your own words whenever possible. Presentations will be in two weeks as per the schedule.</p>
